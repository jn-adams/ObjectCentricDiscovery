# ObjectCentricDiscovery

This repository contains the implementation of the experiments used in the work "Improving Process Discovery Using Object-Centric Process Mining". 

Under Python 3.7, use pip to install the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To re-run the experiment, you can run 
```python main.py```

You can also seperatly generate a random process model (with different models)by using the ```generate_net``` function found in the net_generator.py file.
